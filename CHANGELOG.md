## [0.10.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added
- `OpenRouterClientBuilder::http_client(...)` — allow injecting a custom `reqwest::Client`. Enables HTTP/SOCKS proxies (e.g. for geo-restricted routes), custom timeouts, retry/tracing middleware, mTLS, and other transport-layer customization. The internal default client is preserved when `.http_client(...)` is not called, so existing code is unaffected. See `examples/custom_http_client.rs`.
- Added `OpenRouterExperimentalMetadata` request-header opt-in for chat completions, Responses API, and Anthropic-compatible Messages requests, plus typed chat response access to `service_tier` and `openrouter_metadata`.
- Added typed SDK support for BYOK provider credential management (`GET|POST /byok`, `GET|PATCH|DELETE /byok/{id}`) via `api::byok` and `client.management().*_byok_key(...)` methods.
- Added typed SDK support for observability destination management (`GET|POST /observability/destinations`, `GET|PATCH|DELETE /observability/destinations/{id}`) via `api::observability` and `client.management().*_observability_destination(...)` methods.
- Added embedding multimodal media helpers for audio, video, and file content parts through `EmbeddingContentPart::input_audio(...)`, `input_video(...)`, and `input_file(...)`.
- Added typed guardrail content-filter support, including built-in filter entries, custom regex filters, and provider-specific ZDR flags on guardrail create/update requests and guardrail responses.
- Added typed `supported_voices` model discovery fields and `GenerationData::service_tier` for generation metadata responses.
- Added typed SDK support for `POST /audio/transcriptions`, including `api::audio::{TranscriptionRequest, TranscriptionInputAudio, TranscriptionResponse}` and the canonical `client.audio().transcriptions().create(...)` surface.
- Added typed OpenRouter chat-completion usage cost fields via `ResponseUsage::cost`, `ResponseUsage::cost_details`, `ResponseUsage::is_byok`, and `ResponseCostDetails`.
- Added ergonomic constructors for non-exhaustive helper types such as `ResponseUsage::new`, `ToolCall::new`, `FunctionCall::new`, `JsonSchemaConfig::new`, embedding multimodal parts, and provider-options wrappers.

### Changed
- Breaking: Marked high-churn public SDK request, response, metadata, usage, pricing, discovery, streaming, and upstream taxonomy types as `#[non_exhaustive]`; construct affected request/configuration types through builders, constructors, or helpers, and include wildcard arms when matching affected public enums outside the crate.
- Accepted the 2026-04-29 OpenAPI drift review, including `stt` generation origins and chat usage cost metadata, and kept the repository snapshot at `51 / 51` official OpenAPI endpoint coverage.
- Accepted the 2026-05-03 OpenAPI drift review, including audio transcription support, and restored the repository snapshot to `52 / 52` official OpenAPI endpoint coverage.
- Accepted the 2026-05-15 OpenAPI drift review, including experimental response metadata, guardrail content filters, model supported voices, and generation service tiers, while keeping the repository snapshot at `52 / 52` official OpenAPI endpoint coverage.
- Accepted the 2026-05-19 OpenAPI drift review, including BYOK provider credentials, observability destinations, embeddings multimodal media parts, and Responses schema refreshes, restoring the repository snapshot to `62 / 62` official OpenAPI endpoint coverage.
- Changed the scheduled OpenAPI drift workflow from daily to weekly while keeping manual `workflow_dispatch` runs available.

### Fixed
- Preserved top-level `openrouter_metadata` and `user_id` fields on normalized API errors so guardrail-blocked responses keep their diagnostic metadata.
- Preserved `openrouter_metadata` and future top-level extras on Anthropic Messages `message_stop` stream events.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- Added typed SDK support for `GET /generation/content`, including `client.get_generation_content(...)` and `client.management().get_generation_content(...)`.
- Added typed `num_fetches` support on `GET /generation` metadata responses via `GenerationData`.
- Added typed `response_cache_source_id` support on `GET /generation` metadata responses.
- Added workspace I/O logging fields on typed workspace responses and create/update requests: `io_logging_api_key_ids` and `io_logging_sampling_rate`.
- Added `callback_url` support on `VideoGenerationRequest` for video completion webhooks.
- Added typed SDK support for `GET /workspaces`, `POST /workspaces`, `GET /workspaces/{id}`, `PATCH /workspaces/{id}`, `DELETE /workspaces/{id}`, `POST /workspaces/{id}/members/add`, and `POST /workspaces/{id}/members/remove`, including canonical `client.management()` methods and a runnable `examples/list_workspaces.rs`.
- Added workspace-aware API-key and guardrail support, including `workspace_id` fields on typed models plus `create_api_key_in_workspace(...)`, `list_api_keys_in_workspace(...)`, and `list_guardrails_in_workspace(...)`.
- Added `openrouter-cli workspaces ...` commands, plus `--workspace-id` support for `openrouter-cli keys list|create` and `openrouter-cli guardrails list|create`.
- Added `openrouter-cli workspaces create|update --io-logging-api-key-id`, `--io-logging-sampling-rate`, and `workspaces update --clear-io-logging-api-key-ids` so CLI workspace I/O logging controls match the SDK request surface.
- Added the canonical SDK audio speech surface: `api::audio::{SpeechRequest, SpeechResponseFormat, SpeechProviderOptions}`, `api::audio::create_speech(...)`, and `client.audio().speech().create(...)`.

### Changed
- Breaking: `client.tts().create(...)`, `api::tts::TtsRequest`, `api::tts::TtsResponseFormat`, and `api::tts::create_tts(...)` are now deprecated compatibility aliases; new code should use the canonical `client.audio().speech().create(...)` and `api::audio` names.
- Breaking: newly added and high-churn public request/response types for audio speech, workspace management, workspace-aware keys, generation metadata/content, and video generation are marked `#[non_exhaustive]` where appropriate; use builders for request construction instead of public struct literals.
- The canonical audio speech path targets official `POST /audio/speech` and falls back to legacy `POST /tts` only for route-unavailable signals, including generic plain-text `404/405` status pages, so request-level `404/405` errors on the official endpoint are still preserved.
- Accepted the 2026-04-21 OpenAPI drift review, refreshed the tracked compatibility surfaces, and restored the repository snapshot to `51 / 51` official OpenAPI endpoint coverage.
- Accepted the 2026-04-22 OpenAPI drift review, refreshed the tracked baseline, and kept the repository snapshot at `51 / 51` official OpenAPI endpoint coverage.
- Accepted the 2026-04-23 OpenAPI drift review, refreshed the tracked baseline, and kept the repository snapshot at `51 / 51` official OpenAPI endpoint coverage.
- Accepted the 2026-04-28 OpenAPI drift review, refreshed the tracked baseline, and kept the repository snapshot at `51 / 51` official OpenAPI endpoint coverage.
- Nightly OpenAPI drift reports now keep the raw upstream diff but separately classify changes already covered by the SDK's global request-metadata handling, dynamic `String` taxonomy fields, provider options maps, and Responses `Option`/`Value` parsing, reducing false-positive follow-up noise.
- OpenAPI drift classification now also recognizes flexible plugin payloads, Anthropic Messages hosted-tool option payloads, and Responses tool/output `Value` payloads.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- Added typed SDK support for `POST /tts`, including the canonical `client.tts().create(...)` surface, raw audio-byte handling, and a runnable example.
- Added live smoke coverage for `POST /rerank` and read-only management coverage for `GET /organization/members`.
- Added `openrouter-cli organization members list` for management-key-backed organization member discovery.

### Changed
- Added `X-OpenRouter-Categories` request metadata support across the existing attribution-enabled SDK request surfaces.
- Restored the repository snapshot to `43 / 43` official OpenAPI endpoint coverage and aligned the endpoint matrix, README, and docs.rs surface with the newly implemented text-to-speech endpoint.


## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- Added an `axum` gateway example and a practical typed-tool agent example so the repository covers copyable Rust application patterns instead of only endpoint-level demos.
- Added `docs/cli-automation-workflows.md` with JSON-first shell and CI recipes for discovery, usage reporting, and ephemeral key automation.
- Added `docs/compatibility-update-policy.md` and a reusable upstream-compatibility issue template so upstream OpenRouter changes can be tracked outside normal release cuts.
- Added typed SDK support for `POST /rerank`, `POST /videos`, `GET /videos/models`, `GET /videos/{jobId}`, `GET /videos/{jobId}/content`, and `GET /organization/members`, including canonical `rerank()`, `videos()`, and `management().list_organization_members(...)` surfaces.
- Added runnable examples for rerank requests, video generation submission, and organization-member listing.

### Changed
- Completed the SDK HTTP transport migration from `surf -> isahc -> curl` to a Tokio-native `reqwest + rustls` stack while keeping the canonical domain-oriented client surface and SSE semantics intact.
- Normalized the public HTTP error surface around backend-neutral `HttpRequestError` and `http::StatusCode` so transport details no longer leak through public SDK types.
- Reorganized the README example/docs surface around application patterns, Tokio streaming, and CLI automation workflows.
- Aligned OpenAPI drift follow-up docs and issue wording with the new compatibility-update cadence and reporting surfaces.
- Accepted the 2026-04-18 upstream OpenAPI drift baseline and added typed embedding usage support for `prompt_tokens_details`.
- Restored the repository snapshot to `42 / 42` official endpoint coverage and aligned the endpoint matrix, README, docs.rs surface, and Awesome OpenRouter submission materials with the newly implemented rerank, videos, and organization-member endpoints.

### Removed
- Removed `surf` from the SDK dependency graph, including the transitive `curl` chain that came from the legacy transport stack.
- Removed the public `utils` transport shims `with_bearer_auth`, `with_request_metadata`, `with_client_request_headers`, and `handle_error`. Callers that need custom HTTP glue should keep it in their own application code and treat `openrouter-rs` as the typed domain client layer.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-16

### Removed
- Removed the SDK-level `config` module and related client surface. `openrouter-rs` no longer exports `OpenRouterConfig` / `ModelConfig`, no longer stores `.config(...)` on `OpenRouterClient`, and no longer treats file/profile config as part of the core SDK API. That behavior now belongs in the companion CLI or the caller's own application layer.

### Changed
- Refreshed the canonical SDK docs around the `0.7.x` domain-oriented client surface and kept file/profile config explicitly outside the SDK core.
- Hot live integration coverage now runs as a Responses-first sweep and validates candidate hot models with a minimal Responses API health check before they enter the pool.

### Fixed
- Assistant `content` values that arrive as structured objects or arrays now surface text correctly in chat completion helpers when they contain text parts.
- `HTTP 200` responses that actually contain `{ "error": ... }` payloads now normalize into `OpenRouterError::Api` with provider/API status information instead of surfacing as generic deserialization failures.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-03-12

### Changed
- Standardized contributor/release verification around `just quality` and `just quality-ci`.
- Added live contract release validation coverage and refreshed the README/CLI docs to match the current canonical `0.6.x` domain-oriented surface.
- `openrouter-cli` release automation now runs through tag-driven GitHub Actions publishing with prebuilt binary assets, and the crate now aligns on `openrouter-rs` `0.6.1`.

### Fixed
- `ToolBuilder` now preserves accumulated fields regardless of setter call order.
- Combined model filters and model resolution ordering now preserve caller intent.
- Chat streaming requests now inherit default client headers.
- SSE frame parsing is more resilient across chat, responses, and messages streaming flows.
- Response parsing failures now normalize into consistent API error context across endpoints.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-10

### Removed
- Removed management-key compatibility aliases:
  - `OpenRouterClientBuilder::provisioning_key(...)`
  - `OpenRouterClient::{set_provisioning_key, clear_provisioning_key}`
- Removed deprecated flat API-key pagination shim:
  - `OpenRouterClient::list_api_keys(offset: Option<f64>, include_disabled: Option<bool>)`
- Removed deprecated management auth-code alias:
  - `ManagementClient::exchange_code_for_api_key(...)`
- Removed deprecated legacy-completion compatibility entrypoints:
  - `api::completion::*`
  - `OpenRouterClient::send_completion_request(...)`
- Removed deprecated model-domain aliases:
  - `ModelsClient::list_for_user()`
  - `ModelsClient::count()`

### Changed
- `legacy-completions` is now opt-in (no longer in default crate features).
- Migration docs and smoke coverage now align with the final canonical 0.6 API surface.

### Changed
- Breaking (planned for `0.6.0`) legacy completions isolation:

  - added explicit legacy client namespace: `client.legacy().completions().create(...)`
  - updated docs/migration mapping from old completion calls to legacy namespace and modern chat APIs

  - `OPENROUTER_TEST_REASONING_MODEL`

### Fixed
- Unified messages tool-start events now preserve `content_block_start.index` to keep tool chunks correlatable.
- Unified responses stream now only terminates on `response.completed` (avoids premature close on non-terminal `*.completed` events).
- `guardrails update` now supports explicit allowlist clearing via `--clear-allowed-providers` and `--clear-allowed-models`.
- integration API-key metadata assertions now accept sentinel rate-limit values from live API responses.
- live chat/reasoning integration assertions no longer assume prompt echoing in model outputs.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-02-28

### Added
- Support `cache_control` on multipart text content via `ContentPart::text_with_cache_control`, `ContentPart::cacheable_text`, and `ContentPart::cacheable_text_with_ttl`.

### Changed
- Extended reasoning effort support to include `xhigh`, `minimal`, and `none`.

### Fixed
- Updated examples to read `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and `OPENROUTER_MANAGEMENT_KEY` at runtime (instead of compile-time `.env` macro expansion), preventing CI/build failures.
